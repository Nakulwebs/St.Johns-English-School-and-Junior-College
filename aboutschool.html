  <h1>Motto</h1>

  <img src="schoollogo.jpg" style="width: 200px;">
  <br>
  <p>
    Wisdom is better than Rubies
    <br><br>
    <p>
      Education is what ultimately remains after one has forgotten all that one learnt in Schools and Colleges. The motto of St. John’s aims at imparting wisdom – the ability to think and utilise knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and insight.
      <br><br>  
      Our motto will be a motivating impulse, taking each student on a quest for knowledge, instilling in them passion for discovery, an urge to go beyond the frontiers of the unknown.
      <br>
      The idea is to see that Education is not a cliche-ridden concept entering around class-room conditioning. Each student with the wisdom gained is a discoverer exploring the world around him and coming to terms with life, as it unfolds in all its complexities.<br>
